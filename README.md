# Object Code Graph (ocgraph)

This repo contains *asm2cfg*, (**Assembler to control-flow-graph**), a tool to
read disassembler output and optional corresponding coverage data to produce
control flow graphs including coverage analysis on assembler level.

The *asm2cfg* source code implemented by GTD GmbH is forked from the asm2cfg
repository on [Github](https://github.com/Kazhuu/asm2cfg) and reworked to
function with several architectures and disassembler.

The tool source code is subject to the MIT License as indicated by the headers
of the corresponding source code files.
